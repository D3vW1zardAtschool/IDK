      <h1>Bored At School Games</h1>
      <p>This website is a free resource for all kids at school who are bored to death by school work or just want a break from school, although it can be used by anyone who wants to play video games. I actually am a kid who likes to play games at school myself. All these games can run on trashy school chromebooks, but can also run on pretty much anything with a keyboard. I tested all these sites and they aren't blocked. A lot of kids in my class play video games like these ones. From 1v1 lol to minecraft to slope unblocked, we provide you with resources (video games) so that you <em>NEVER</em> get bored at school or anywhere else! Enjoy!</p>

              <p>These sites contain lots of free video games for kids to play. I have no affiliation with any of these sites, but they do the same thing as this one does: they provide free video games to bored people (mainly kids at school.)</p></section>

          <section>
          <p>Minecraft Unblocked is the most popular video game by far. Pretty much everyone plays it while they play video games at school. It also has a lot of glitches because it is one of the oldest editions of JavaScript minecraft. Hint: you can run Minecraft a lot faster if you download a map.</p></section>
